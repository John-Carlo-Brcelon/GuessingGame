Overview

This is a Word Guessing Game built using Python's tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI). Players must guess a word based on its definition, with different difficulty levels and categories available. The game features a timed challenge where players can make multiple attempts to guess the correct word.


Features

Difficulty Levels: The game offers four difficulty levelsâ€”Easy, Intermediate, Hard, and Difficult. The time limit for guessing changes based on the selected level:

Easy: 25 seconds

Intermediate: 20 seconds

Hard: 15 seconds

Difficult: 10 seconds

Categories: Each difficulty level has several categories like Animals, Places, Fruits, and Random words.

Word Templates: Words are presented with some letters hidden, and players must guess the full word.

Timed Challenge: A countdown timer shows how much time remains to guess the word. If time runs out or attempts are exhausted, the game moves to the next word.

Score System: Players accumulate points for every correct guess and can track their score throughout the game.

Input Validation: Players are restricted to alphabetic inputs, ensuring valid guesses.
